You are rebuilding the BCALM onboarding + CV upload UX in my Replit app.
Use Node.js + Express backend, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend (no React).
IMPORTANT: Do not invent or add any copy beyond what I provide below.
Use the exact screen titles, subtitles, option labels, helper text, and CTA text I specify.
Do not add tooltips, extra descriptions, or alternative wording.

Flow overview

After SSO login/signup, if profiles.onboarding_completed = false, show /onboarding.
Onboarding is 3 steps + upload.
User can skip Step 2 or Step 3.
On skip or completion, mark onboarding as completed and proceed to upload.

Database assumptions (Supabase)

Table: profiles

id (uuid, primary key, equals auth user id)

current_status text nullable

target_role text nullable

years_experience int nullable

onboarding_completed boolean default false

All onboarding writes update this table for the logged-in user.

Routes to implement

GET /onboarding → serves Step 1 HTML

GET /onboarding/role → Step 2 HTML

GET /onboarding/experience → Step 3 HTML

GET /upload → Upload CV HTML

API:

GET /api/profile/me

POST /api/profile/status

POST /api/profile/role

POST /api/profile/experience

POST /api/profile/complete-onboarding

Each POST updates Supabase profiles for current user.

Global UI rules

Layout is centered card with soft radius 18px.

Background: very dark purple gradient like current theme (keep).

Top shows small text: Step X of 3 · ~20 sec for Step 1 & 2, and Step 3 of 3 · ~10 sec for Step 3.

Primary CTA button disabled until a selection is made (except skip).

Animations: subtle fade between screens.

Only one primary action per screen.

Buttons (exact):

Primary: “Continue”

Secondary link: “Skip for now”

Logic:

On option select, enable Continue.

POST /api/profile/status with { current_status }.

If no cluster known, show generic roles.
