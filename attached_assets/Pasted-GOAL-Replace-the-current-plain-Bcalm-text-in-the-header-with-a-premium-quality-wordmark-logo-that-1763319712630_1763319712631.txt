GOAL:
Replace the current plain “Bcalm” text in the header with a premium-quality wordmark logo that feels modern, calm, trustworthy, and brand-defining — similar in aesthetic to Apple, Notion, Stripe, or Linear.

This logo is text-only, but with deliberate typography, spacing, and refinement (not simply “text in a font”).
No colored letters. No gimmicks. This is the premium option.

1️⃣ Font Selection (Very Important)

Use a clean, modern, premium sans-serif — NOT a default system font.

Approved fonts (pick one & use consistently across brand):

Inter (variable weight preferred)

Manrope

SF Pro Display (if license allows; closest to Apple)

Plus Jakarta Sans

Satoshi (if available)

General Sans

Use the same font family everywhere on the site for consistency.

2️⃣ Logo Typography Settings

Implement “Bcalm” with the following properties:

Weight: 600 (semi-bold, not bold)

Letter spacing (tracking): 0.5px to 1px

Word spacing: default

Case: Title case → Bcalm (not uppercase)

Color: #111111 (rich dark grey, not pure black)

This should feel confident but not loud.

3️⃣ Micro-adjustments for Logo Refinement

Apply these details so it looks like a designed mark:

a. Slightly tighten spacing between the B and c

Reduce kerning between B and c by –1px or –2px (visually tuned)
This makes the wordmark feel more polished and balanced.

b. Slightly increase spacing between “calm” letters

Apply +0.5–1px tracking to c a l m

This creates a visual “breath” after the strong B.

c. Very subtle rounding

If the font supports a “rounded” variant or stylistic set:

Use mildly rounded terminals (not bubble-like or childish)
This aligns with the emotional meaning of calm.

4️⃣ Monochrome Brand Rule

The logo must always be in one solid color:

Default: #111111

Dark mode: #ffffff

Never mix colors inside the wordmark.
This is what gives it premium strength and long-term brand coherence.

All brand color usage should happen around the logo, not inside it.

5️⃣ Spacing & Placement in Header
Header left-side placement:

Add extra left padding so the wordmark has room to “breathe.”

Vertical alignment: perfectly centered with the Free Resources CTA.

Minimum padding:

Desktop: padding-left: 24px;

Mobile: padding-left: 16px;

Size:

Desktop font-size: 20px

Tablet: 18px

Mobile: 17px

The logo must never wrap.
Ensure white-space: nowrap.

6️⃣ Optional Accent Version (Secondary Use Only)

Implement the following secondary (not primary) variation for use in internal decks or banners (NOT in header):

Add a thin, short purple underline under the B only:

Color: brand purple #6c47ff

Width: equal to B’s width

Thickness: 2px

Offset: 2–3px below baseline

This version must NOT appear in the site header —
header uses the pure monochrome primary wordmark only.

7️⃣ Final Deliverables

Replace “Bcalm” in the header with the premium wordmark using the rules above.

Ensure it displays crisply on all screen sizes (no shifting or pixelation).

Ensure the Free Resources pill CTA aligns vertically with it perfectly.

Add white-space: nowrap; to avoid wrapping on small screens.

Confirm the logo sits inside the fixed header bar and never overlaps the hero section.
