IMPORTANT:
The card layout will NOT be the same as before.
We are now creating only two cards, and the layout of these cards will be different and redesigned from scratch.
The new layout should follow a premium, Apple-like, clean aesthetic — minimal, elegant, high-trust, and visually calm.

📌 CARD 1 — Instructor Card (Apple-Like Premium Design)
Title (top section):

“Learn From a Product Leader Who Turned ₹3.2L Into ₹2.4Cr 

Required Elements & Layout Structure:

Instructor Photo (Large, Clean, Centered)

High-quality portrait

Neutral/soft background

Minimal shadow

Apple “Meet the team” style

Bullet 1 — LinkedIn Section
• A LinkedIn Presence Built on Clarity and Trust

Add a subtle LinkedIn icon + hyperlink directly beneath this bullet : https://www.linkedin.com/in/rakesh-malloju-b648ab92/

Keep the link visually minimal (Apple styling)

Bullet 2 — Career Transformation With Offer Letters
• A Career Transformation Driven by a Repeatable System

Add a clean row or grid of offer letter thumbnails

Each thumbnail shows a career jump step (₹3.2L → ₹15L → ₹45L → ₹1Cr → ₹2.4Cr)

Minimalistic document-card style, soft borders

Bullet 3 — Senior Director Badge
• Senior Director at a $7B YC Company

No visuals needed here — text is the focus

Maintain high contrast and clean spacing

Overall Style for Card 1:
