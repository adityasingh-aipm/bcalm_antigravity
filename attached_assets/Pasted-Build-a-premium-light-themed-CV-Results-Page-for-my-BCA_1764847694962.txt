Build a premium, light-themed CV Results Page for my BCALM app (Node.js + Express backend, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend).
The page must feel like an “aha moment”: instant clarity, then progressive depth.
Remove all CTAs from the top. Only show actions at bottom: Send on my Mail (left) and Share (right).
Implement routes and UI exactly as described.

Data contract

Backend endpoint:

GET /api/analysis/:jobId returns:

{
  "status": "complete",
  "jobId": "...",
  "report": {
    "role_preset": "...",
    "overall_score": 56,
    "score_breakdown": {
      "ats": {"score":12,"notes":"..."},
      "impact": {"score":20,"notes":"..."},
      "role_signals": {"score":10,"notes":"..."},
      "job_match": {"score":0,"skipped":true,"notes":"..."}
    },
    "summary": "...",
    "top_strengths": [{"strength":"...","evidence":"..."}],
    "top_fixes": [{"fix":"...","expected_score_lift":4,"how_to_do_it":"...","why_it_matters":"..."}],
    "seven_step_plan": [{"step":1,"task":"...","output_expected":"..."}],
    "bullet_review": [{"original_bullet":"...","why_weak":"...","recommended_text":"...","placeholders_to_fill":["METRIC"]}],
    "info_needed_from_user": ["..."],
    "job_match_section": {"top_jd_requirements":[],"top_gaps":[],"match_verdict":"..."},
    "cta":"..."
  }
}


If status is not complete, show a full-page loading state.

Page routes

/results/:jobId → full private results

/share/:jobId → public share poster (no private details)

Results page layout (implement exactly)
1) Hero “Aha” Block (NO CTAs here)

Centered BCALM logo small at top.

Animated score ring (SVG donut) counts up 0→score in ~700ms.

Big score number overall_score/100.

Verdict label computed from score:

<40 “Needs work”

40–59 “Good foundation”

60–79 “Strong”

80+ “Excellent”

Role preset pill: Target role: {role_preset}

1-sentence coach summary: use first sentence of summary.

2) “Quickest win” strip (right after hero)

Pull from top_fixes[0]:

Text: “Quickest win (+{expected_score_lift} pts): {fix}”

If no fixes, hide this strip.

3) Score Breakdown Cards (2x2 grid)

Cards for ATS, Impact, Role Signals, Job Match:

show score big + 1-line truncated notes

tiny “View details” chevron expands card to show full notes

If job_match.skipped true, show small badge “JD missing”.

4) Strengths & Fixes (emotional core)

Two columns on desktop, stacked on mobile:

Top Strengths

heading: “What you’re already doing right”

show first 3 with evidence

“Show all strengths” expands rest

Highest ROI Fixes

heading: “What will boost your score fastest”

show first 3

each fix card shows:

fix text

expected_score_lift badge like “+4 pts”

accordion for “how_to_do_it” and “why_it_matters”

5) 7-Step Plan Timeline

Vertical checklist / timeline style

each step shows step number, task, output_expected (muted)

6) Deep Dive Sections (collapsed by default)

Create accordion groups with counts:

Bullet Review ({bullet_review.length})

each item shows:

original bullet (muted monospace)

why_weak

recommended_text

placeholders chips

Job Match Deep Dive

If skipped or empty requirements:

empty state: “Upload a JD to unlock role-specific fit scoring.”

Else:

table of top_jd_requirements with status pills (strong/weak/missing)

top_gaps as small cards

Info Needed From You ({info_needed_from_user.length})

list of questions as chips

7) Bottom Action Row (ONLY CTAs on page)

Sticky bar is NOT allowed. Place at end of content.
Two large buttons side-by-side:

Left: “Send on my Mail”

Right: “Share”

Send on my Mail flow

On click:

If user not authenticated:

open modal: “Login to email your report”

trigger Supabase Google SSO login

After login:

call POST /api/email-report with { jobId }

show toast popup:
“Sent! Check your inbox in 30 seconds.”

no navigation away from results.

Share flow

Right CTA opens a share modal with:

Preview mini share card

Buttons:

Copy link

WhatsApp

Telegram

X (Twitter)

LinkedIn

Link used: ${BASE_URL}/share/${jobId}

If Web Share API exists, use native share first.

Public share page /share/:jobId

Render only a share poster, no private analysis:

Title: “I got my CV Score on BCALM”

Score big + verdict

Role preset pill

Top 1 strength only

CTA line: “Get your free CV Score → bcalm.org”

meta tags for social preview (OpenGraph + Twitter)

Styling (lighter than current)

Use airy premium palette:

Background: soft lavender/white #F7F5FF

Cards: white #FFFFFF with subtle purple tint

Primary purple: #6D4CFF

Text: near-black #15131C

Muted: #6B6480

Soft shadows (no neon glow)

Rounded corners 16–20px

Spacious padding

Smooth fade/slide-in reveals for sections on scroll

Files to produce

server.js

serves /results/:jobId and /share/:jobId

includes POST /api/email-report placeholder that logs for now

public/results.html

public/results.css

public/results.js

public/share.html

public/share.css

public/share.js

Everything must run end-to-end on Replit with clean, commented code and robust null/empty handling.
