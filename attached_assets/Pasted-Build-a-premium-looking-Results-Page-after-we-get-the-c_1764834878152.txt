Build a premium-looking Results Page after we get the callback response form n8n.
The page fetches analysis from /api/analysis/:jobId and renders result_json.result which is a JSON object like the sample below.
Create a beautiful purple/black UI, aha-first, with progressive disclosure and a public share flow.

Data contract

Backend endpoint:

GET /api/analysis/:jobId returns:

{
  "status": "complete",
  "jobId": "...",
  "report": {
    "role_preset": "...",
    "overall_score": 42,
    "score_breakdown": { "ats": {...}, "impact": {...}, "role_signals": {...}, "job_match": {...} },
    "summary": "...",
    "top_strengths": [...],
    "top_fixes": [...],
    "seven_step_plan": [...],
    "bullet_review": [...],
    "info_needed_from_user": [...],
    "job_match_section": {...},
    "cta": "..."
  }
}


If status is not complete, show a loading state.

Page routes

/results/:jobId

/share/:jobId (public, simplified share poster only)

Results page layout (implement exactly)

A. Hero Summary (first screen)

Big circular score ring (SVG donut) showing overall_score/100

Status label derived from score:

<40 “Needs work”

40–59 “Good foundation”

60–79 “Strong”

80+ “Excellent”

Role preset pill

1-line summary (first sentence of summary)

Primary CTA button: “Re-score after edits” → /upload

Secondary CTA: “Upload JD for fit match” → /upload?jd=true

Share row: “Share your score” + “Copy link”

B. Breakdown grid (2x2 cards)
Cards for ATS, Impact, Role Signals, Job Match:

show score big + short notes

if job_match.skipped true, show “JD missing” badge

C. Strengths & Fixes (two-column, stack on mobile)

Left: Top Strengths (show first 3, “Show all” expands)

Right: Highest ROI Fixes (first 3, each with expected_score_lift badge, accordion for how_to_do_it)

D. 7-Step Plan timeline

vertical checklist style

E. Bullet Review deep dive

collapsed accordion by default

each item shows original bullet, why weak, recommended text, placeholder chips

F. Job Match Deep Dive

If skipped → empty state + CTA to upload JD

Else render requirements table and gaps

G. Info Needed

list of questions

H. Sticky bottom action bar

Primary: Re-score after edits

Secondary: Upload JD

Share icon

Share flow

On /results/:jobId, create a Share Card section (mini poster) with:

“I got my CV Score on bcalm”

score big

role preset

top 1 strength

“Try yours → bcalm.org”

Add a “Share” button that:

Uses Web Share API if available:

title: “My CV Score on bcalm”

text: I scored ${score}/100 for ${role}. Get your free CV score at bcalm.org

url: ${BASE_URL}/share/${jobId}

Fallback:

Copy link to clipboard

Provide Twitter and LinkedIn share links using share URL

/share/:jobId should render only the share card in a clean centered layout, SEO friendly, no private data (no bullet review, no fixes list).

Styling

Purple/black aesthetic

soft glow background

big rounded CTAs

responsive, elegant typography

subtle animations (fade/slide on section reveal)

Deliverables

Produce files:

server.js (express routes for /results, /share, /api/analysis proxy if needed)

public/results.html

public/share.html

public/results.js

public/results.css

Add clear comments and ensure everything runs end-to-end on Replit.

Use the sample report shape above to harden null/empty states.
