You are an expert full-stack developer tasked with building a Free Resources management system for a Bcalm product management website. The website is built on Replit using React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Express.js backend, and Drizzle ORM.

## Project Requirements

### Feature 1: Public Resources Page (/resources)
- Landing page displaying 3 categories of free resources:
  1. Free Prompt Library for PMs (PDFs/Documents)
  2. Top 20 Books for PMs (PDFs/Documents)
  3. Top Product Management Videos and Articles (Videos/Links)
- Beautiful card-based grid layout using Shadcn UI components
- User signup/login system (email + password) to access downloads
- Download button that triggers file download for authenticated users
- Unauthenticated users see "Sign up to Download" button that opens signup modal
- Display resource metadata: title, description, file type, file size, upload date
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

### Feature 2: Admin Dashboard (/admin/resources)
- Admin login with JWT authentication
- Resource management interface showing table of all resources
- Admin can:
  - Upload new resources (PDF, DOC, Video files up to 500MB)
  - Edit resource details (title, description, category, type)
  - Delete resources (soft delete - marks as inactive)
  - View download statistics (total downloads per resource, most downloaded resource)
- Upload form with validation using React Hook Form + Zod:
  - Title (required, min 3 chars)
  - Description (required, min 10 chars)
  - Category dropdown (prompts, books, videos)
  - Type dropdown (pdf, doc, video, link)
  - File input (optional - for external links)
- Dashboard stats cards showing:
  - Total resources count
  - Total downloads count
  - Most downloaded resource name
- Resources table with columns: Title, Category, Type, File Size, Uploaded Date, Actions
- Action buttons: Edit, Delete (with confirmation dialog)
- Loading states and error handling throughout

### Feature 3: Backend API Endpoints
Build all necessary Express.js endpoints:

**Authentication:**
- POST /api/resources/auth/signup - User registration
- POST /api/resources/auth/login - User login

**Resources (Public):**
- GET /api/resources - Fetch all active resources
- GET /api/resources/download/:resourceId - Download resource (authenticated only)

**Admin:**
- POST /api/resources/admin/upload - Upload new resource (admin only)
- PUT /api/resources/admin/:resourceId - Update resource (admin only)
- DELETE /api/resources/admin/:resourceId - Delete resource (admin only)
- GET /api/resources/admin/stats - Get download statistics (admin only)

Middleware:
- JWT authentication middleware for protected routes
- Admin-only middleware to verify admin status
- File upload middleware using multer (handle PDFs, DOCs, Videos)

### Feature 4: Database Schema
Create Drizzle ORM tables:

1. **resources_users** table:
   - id (primary key)
   - email (unique)
   - password (hashed with bcrypt)
   - name
   - is_admin (boolean)
   - created_at, updated_at (timestamps)

2. **resources** table:
   - id (primary key)
   - title
   - description
   - category (prompts, books, videos)
   - type (pdf, doc, video, link)
   - file_path
   - file_size
   - is_active (boolean, for soft deletes)
   - uploaded_date, updated_at (timestamps)

3. **download_logs** table:
   - id (primary key)
   - user_id (foreign key)
   - resource_id (foreign key)
   - downloaded_at (timestamp)

## Technical Requirements

**Frontend:**
- Use React 18 with TypeScript
- Shadcn UI components: Button, Input, Card, Dialog, Select, Textarea
- React Hook Form + Zod for all form validation
- TanStack Query (React Query) for data fetching and state management
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Wouter for routing

**Backend:**
- Express.js with TypeScript
- Drizzle ORM for database queries
- Multer for file uploads
- JWT (jsonwebtoken) for authentication
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- CORS enabled

**Storage:**
- Store uploaded files in `/uploads/resources` directory on Replit
- Serve static files from this directory

## Code Quality
- Full TypeScript typing (no `any` types)
- Proper error handling and validation
- Loading and error states in UI
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Accessibility best practices
- Comments for complex logic
- Consistent code style matching your existing project

## Integration Requirements
- Integrate into existing Replit Express server
- Add route handler: `app.use('/api/resources', resourcesRouter)`
- Add static file serving: `app.use('/uploads/resources', express.static(...))`
- Add routes to Wouter: `/resources` and `/admin/resources`
- Use existing database connection and Drizzle setup
- Add environment variable: `JWT_SECRET` to .env
- Install dependencies: multer, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken

## Deliverables
1. Complete backend routes file (resources.ts)
2. Frontend ResourcesPage component (ResourcesPage.tsx)
3. Frontend Admin Dashboard component (ResourcesAdminDashboard.tsx)
4. Drizzle ORM schema definitions (resourcesSchema.ts)
5. All files properly integrated and ready to run
6. Error-free, production-ready code

## Success Criteria
✓ Users can sign up and download resources
✓ Admin can log in and manage resources
✓ Files upload and download correctly
✓ Download stats are tracked and displayed
✓ All components are responsive and animated
✓ Code is fully typed with TypeScript
✓ All validations work properly
✓ System handles errors gracefully
