**GOAL**
The hero is strong, but currently feels visually heavy in the middle and slightly noisy because all elements (CTAs, social proof, cohort card) have similar weight.

We want to:

1. Clarify **visual hierarchy** (what’s most important).
2. Reduce the feeling of “4 big blocks in a column.”
3. Make the **cohort card** clearly the key informational highlight.
4. Make the **social proof** lighter and calmer (secondary).
5. Smooth typography & spacing so the hero scroll feels premium and effortless.

### 1️⃣ Hero Headline & Copy Tweaks

**Current:**
“Become Interview-ready for AI Product in 30 Days”

**Update headline copy to avoid awkward hyphen and improve rhythm:**

Use either:

* **“Become interview-ready for AI Product roles in 30 days”**
  (preferred: adds “roles” and keeps line breaks cleaner)

Implement:

* Keep main hero heading font size and weight as currently used.
* Adjust max-width / line-height so **“interview-ready”** stays on one line (avoid line break after “Interview-”).

---

### 2️⃣ CTA Block (Buttons)

Keep both buttons as they are, but adjust spacing:

* Space between headline/subheadline and **Join the Waitlist**: ~16–20px.
* Space between **Join the Waitlist** and **Schedule a Call**: ~8–12px.

Goal: CTAs feel like **one pair**.

### 3️⃣ Social Proof Pill — Make It Lighter & Secondary

**Current:** big dark-ish purple rounded block, visually heavy like a third button.

**Change to a lighter, calmer chip-style element.**

**Content:**

> 🧑‍🎓 **Trusted by 200+ students**
> from IITs, BITS, NITs, and IIITs

**Design requirements:**

* Place **below the two CTAs**, with `margin-top: 12–16px`.
* Full-width within container, but visually lighter.

**Styles:**

* Background: `#f5f3ff` (or similar very soft purple tint).
* Text color: `#111111` or `#1f2933`.
* “200+ students” in `font-weight: 600`.
* Layout:

  * Icon on the left (🧑‍🎓), text stacked in two lines.
* Border-radius: `9999px` (pill).
* Padding: `8px 14px` (mobile), `10px 18px` (desktop).
* No shadow or only **very subtle shadow**.

**Example (Tailwind-style):**

```html
<div class="mt-4 w-full">
  <div class="flex items-center justify-center w-full px-4 py-2 rounded-full bg-purple-50 text-gray-900 text-xs sm:text-sm text-center">
    <span class="mr-2">🧑‍🎓</span>
    <span>
      <span class="font-semibold">Trusted by 200+ students</span>
      <span class="hidden sm:inline"> from IITs, BITS, NITs, and IIITs</span>
      <span class="sm:hidden block"> from IITs, BITS, NITs & IIITs</span>
    </span>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 4️⃣ Cohort Highlight Card — Make It the Informational Anchor

The cohort info is critical. It should stand out **more than the social proof**, but less “button-like” than the primary CTA.

**Content structure:**

* Label: `NEXT COHORT`
* Main line: `Starts: December 2, 2025`
* Subtext: `Limited seats · Applications reviewed on a rolling basis`

**Design requirements:**

* Place **below the social proof pill** with `margin-top: 10–14px`.
* Full-width card with strong contrast against hero background.
* Keep the calendar icon at the top left or aligned left.

**Styles:**

* Background: slightly lighter or more solid than hero:

  * e.g. `#0b1020` or `#111827`.
* Text color: `#ffffff` for main text; `#9ca3af` for label & subtext.
* Border-radius: `16px` (not fully pill-shaped; distinguish from pill).
* Padding: `14–18px` mobile, `18–22px` desktop.
* Very soft shadow: `0 12px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.35)` or keep current if already subtle.

**Typography inside:**

* Label “NEXT COHORT”: uppercase, small:

  * `font-size: 10–11px`
  * `letter-spacing: 0.12em`
  * `color: #9ca3af`
* Main date line:

  * `font-size: 14–16px` on mobile, `16–18px` desktop
  * `font-weight: 600`
* Subtext:

  * `font-size: 11–13px`
  * `color: #9ca3af`
  * `margin-top: 4px`

**Example (Tailwind-style):**

```html
<div class="mt-3 w-full">
  <div class="flex items-start gap-3 rounded-2xl bg-[#0b1020] text-white px-4 py-3">
    <div class="mt-1 text-lg">📅</div>
    <div class="flex flex-col">
      <span class="text-[10px] tracking-[0.2em] uppercase text-gray-400">
        Next Cohort
      </span>
      <span class="text-sm sm:text-base font-semibold mt-1">
        Starts: December 2, 2025
      </span>
      <span class="text-[11px] sm:text-xs text-gray-400 mt-1">
        Limited seats · Applications reviewed on a rolling basis
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 5️⃣ Vertical Rhythm & Spacing into “Why Bcalm Works”

**Goal:** Cohort card should feel like the **footer of the hero**, and “Why Bcalm Works” like the **start of a new section**.

Adjust spacing:

* Space between cohort card and “Why Bcalm Works”: **24–32px** (more than the spacing between elements inside the hero).
* Ensure “Why Bcalm Works” heading sits within the same horizontal container as hero content.

This gives a clear rhythm:

Hero Content → CTAs → light social proof → strong cohort highlight → **breathing space** → next section.

---

### 6️⃣ Shape & Contrast Consistency

* **Buttons (Join / Schedule):** keep as solid pills with gradient/flat fill as they are.
* **Social proof pill:** lighter color, pill radius, minimal shadow.
* **Cohort card:** rectangular/soft-rounded panel (16px), darker, more solid feel.

This shape system helps users visually distinguish:

* Actions (buttons)
* Trust label (pill)
* Key info (card)

---

### 7️⃣ Responsive Behavior

On **mobile** (the current screenshot):

* Ensure all elements stay within side paddings (no edge collision).
* All text wraps naturally (no clipping / horizontal scroll).
* Minimum touch-friendly spacing between interactive elements (~8–12px vertical).

On **desktop**:

* You may slightly widen the content container but keep the same vertical order.
* Increase hero max-width but maintain consistent left/right alignment across hero and “Why Bcalm Works”.

---

### 8️⃣ Clean-Up & Final QA Checklist

After implementing:

* Check on a typical mobile viewport (e.g. 390×844):

  * Does my eye go: **headline → Join the Waitlist → Next cohort date → social proof → scroll**?
* Confirm:

  * The social proof pill feels **light & secondary**, not like a third CTA.
  * The cohort card is clearly readable and visually anchored.
  * There’s a distinct, comfortable gap before “Why Bcalm Works”.

---

**This set of changes should make the hero feel:**

* Premium and calm
* Clear in what matters
* High-conversion but not pushy
* Visually lighter in the middle, with a strong, confident “cohort anchor” before users scroll.

Please implement exactly per spec above.
