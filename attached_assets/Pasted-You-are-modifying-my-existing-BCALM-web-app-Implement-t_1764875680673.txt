You are modifying my existing BCALM web app. Implement the following EXACT UX + copy + logic. Do NOT add any extra text/copy beyond what I specify. Do NOT invent new headings, helper lines, tooltips, labels, empty states, or microcopy. Use ONLY the strings I provide.

1) Landing Page CTAs (two intent-based entries)
A) Primary Hero CTA (cold users / value-first)

On the landing hero section:

Main CTA button text EXACT: "Check my CV"

Small helper text directly under this CTA EXACT: "Free • 2 min • private"

Clicking this CTA should scroll/navigate to the CV upload flow.

If user is not logged in and not onboarded, allow them to proceed; do NOT force auth before upload.

This hero CTA must be the visually dominant CTA on DWeb and MWeb.

B) Secondary Nav CTA (warm users / start-first)

In the top nav bar (right side):

Secondary button text EXACT: "Start for free"

Next to it a text link EXACT: "Sign in"

"Start for free" is visually secondary to hero CTA (smaller or outlined).

Clicking "Start for free" opens a centered modal lead form (see section 2).

2) Warm Lead Modal (opened from nav CTA)

Modal design:

Centered, minimal, no extra decoration or copy.

Title text EXACT: "Start your journey"

Subtitle text EXACT: "Get your plan + CV score in minutes."

Input labels EXACT: "Full name", "Mobile number"

Placeholders EXACT: "Enter your name", "10-digit mobile number"

Primary button text EXACT: "Continue"

Small reassurance line under button EXACT: "No spam. We’ll only use this to share your score & plan."

Close icon (X) top-right.

Behavior:

On submit, save lead in Supabase leads table (full_name, mobile, source="nav_start_for_free", created_at).

After successful submit, route user into onboarding step 1 immediately (see section 4).

Do NOT show auth UI in this modal.

3) CV Upload Flow (cold path from hero CTA)

CV Upload screen copy must be EXACT:

Title: "Upload your CV"

Subtitle: "Get your personalized CV analysis powered by AI"

Dropzone text: "Drag & drop your CV here"

Dropzone subtext: "or click to browse (PDF, DOC, DOCX)"

Optional JD toggle label: "Add job description (optional)"

Benefits header: "What you'll get:"

Benefits bullets EXACT (no additions):

"Overall CV score out of 100"

"Detailed breakdown by category"

"Actionable improvements"

"Role-specific recommendations"

Primary button: "Analyze my CV"

Bottom tuning line (auto-filled): "Targeting: {target_role or 'General role'} | {current_status label}"

Do not add any other copy.

Behavior:

Allow upload without login.

If user not onboarded, show onboarding before analysis (after file choose OR on clicking Analyze).

Parse CV to text and store in Supabase cv_submissions (cv_text text column, meta jsonb column holds onboarding + file info).

Trigger n8n webhook POST to:
https://adityabcalm.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/cv-score/start

with JSON body:
{
"meta": {
"jobId": "<uuid>",
"submissionId": "<uuid>",
"userId": "<nullable if not logged in>",
"current_status": "...",
"target_role": "... or null",
"years_experience": 0,
"source": "bcalm_web",
"uploaded_at": "<iso>"
},
"cv_text": "<string>",
"jd_text": "<string or null>"
}

Create analysis_jobs row before webhook with status="processing".

Redirect to /processing?jobId=...

4) Onboarding (2-step, simple + delightful)

Onboarding occurs for:

any user without onboarding_completed=true in profiles table

regardless of login state (store to Supabase using anonymous userId or temp id cookie)

Step 1: Current status

Copy EXACT:

Title: "Let’s personalize your experience"

Subtitle: "This helps us tailor your CV analysis"
Options EXACT (3 cards):

"Student / Fresher"

description: "Currently studying or recently graduated"

"Working Professional"

description: "Currently employed and looking to grow"

"Switching Careers"

description: "Transitioning from another field"
No other options. No "Not sure yet" here.

Buttons:

Primary: "Next"

No skip on step 1.

Logic:

Save current_status.

Set years_experience=0 for all users (silent default).

Step 2: Target role

Copy EXACT:

Title: "What role are you targeting?"

Subtitle: "We'll optimize your CV for this role"
Chips:

Provide dynamic chip presets based on current_status (use existing logic).

Always include chip "Not sure yet".
Input placeholder EXACT: "Or type a custom role..."

Buttons:

Left: "Back"

Right primary: "Next"

Under buttons a text link EXACT: "Skip for now"

Logic:

If "Not sure yet" chosen or skipped → target_role=null and proceed.

Completion:

If user clicks Next OR skip on step 2, mark onboarding_completed=true and save profile to Supabase profiles table (current_status, target_role, years_experience=0).

If user closes onboarding mid-way:

Do NOT mark completed.

Re-nudge next session.

5) Results Page (aha moment, clean start)

Results page uses analysis_jobs.result_json.result object.

Layout rules:

No top CTAs for share, JD, or rescore.

Show score + breakdown immediately.

Top section:

Circular score meter (0–100) using overall_score.

Under meter show a qualitative label derived from score (you can compute label but DO NOT display any extra copy besides label itself).

Role pill showing role_preset if present.

Sections order:

Score Breakdown (4 cards: ATS/Structure, Impact, Role Signals, Job Match)

Coach Summary (use summary)

Top Strengths

Highest-ROI Fixes (top_fixes)

Bullet Review (collapsible) only if bullet_review exists

Job Match Deep Dive (collapsible) only if job_match_section has content
No extra headings besides those listed.

Bottom CTAs ONLY (sticky footer):

Left button text EXACT: "Send on my mail"

Right button text EXACT: "Share"

Send on my mail behavior:

If not authenticated → trigger Supabase auth modal (Google + email) after click.

After login/signup success, call backend /api/send-result-email?jobId=... to email full result to user.

Show centered success popup with EXACT text:

Title: "Sent!"

Body: "Check your inbox for your CV review."

Share behavior:

Open share sheet/modal with options:

Copy link

WhatsApp

Telegram

X

LinkedIn
No extra copy besides option labels.
Public share page should summarize:

overall_score

role_preset

1–2 top_strengths

1 top_fix
and include a CTA link back to landing:

CTA text EXACT: "Check your CV"
Do not add other marketing copy.

6) Tech + tables (Supabase)

Use existing Supabase project credentials from env.

Ensure tables:

profiles (user_id pk, current_status text, target_role text nullable, years_experience int default 0, onboarding_completed boolean default false)

leads (id uuid pk, full_name text, mobile text, source text, created_at timestamp)

cv_submissions (id uuid pk, user_id nullable, cv_text text, meta jsonb, created_at)

analysis_jobs (id uuid pk, submission_id uuid, user_id nullable, status text, result_json jsonb, created_at, completed_at)

Integrate callback:
POST https://bcalm.org/api/analysis/callback

Store payload into analysis_jobs.result_json and set status="complete".

7) Constraints

DO NOT add any extra copy anywhere.

DO NOT rename buttons or headings.

Keep styling aligned to BCALM brand but slightly lighter background for results (improve contrast).

Maintain responsive behavior for MWeb and DWeb.

Test all flows end-to-end:
landing → hero CTA → onboarding (2 steps) → upload → processing → callback mocked → results
landing → nav CTA → lead modal → onboarding (2 steps) → upload → results
Provide the updated code files and a short checklist of what you tested.
