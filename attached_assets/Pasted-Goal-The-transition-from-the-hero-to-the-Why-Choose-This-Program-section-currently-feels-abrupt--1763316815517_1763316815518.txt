Goal:
The transition from the hero to the “Why Choose This Program” section currently feels abrupt, weak, and “template-ish.”
We want this fold to feel as premium, modern, and intentional as the hero, with smooth visual rhythm and clearer hierarchy.

Implement the following layout, spacing, typography, and visual style changes.

1️⃣ Section Structure & Spacing

Current issue:
Large empty gap after the CTAs, then a small, weak heading and bulky white cards with heavy shadows.

Change to:

Keep the hero exactly as it is.

Immediately below the hero CTAs, add the “Why” section with consistent container width.

Layout rules:

Wrap this section in the same container as the hero content:
max-width: 1080px; margin: 0 auto; padding-left/right: 16–24px.

Vertical spacing:

Space between the bottom of the “Schedule a Call” button and the section heading: 48–64px (not huge).

Space between section heading and first card: 24–32px.

Space between cards: 16–24px.

2️⃣ Section Heading: Stronger & More Confident

Current: “Why Choose This Program” (small, light, generic).

Change heading text to (choose one and use it consistently):

“Why Bcalm Works”
or

“Why Students Love This Program”

Heading style:

Font-size: 22–24px on mobile, 26–28px on desktop.

Font-weight: 600.

Color: #ffffff if on dark background, or #111111 if on light background (see section background below).

Centered alignment is fine, but keep it consistent with hero alignment.

Add a short subtitle below the heading:

Example:
Built from real hiring experience, real product journeys, and real outcomes.

Font-size: 14–16px

Color: slightly muted (#d0d0d0 on dark or #555555 on light)

Margin-bottom: 16–24px

3️⃣ Background Transition for the Section

Current: Cards sit on the same dark background as hero, making the white blocks feel harsh and disconnected.

Change to:

Option A (recommended):

Keep the overall page background dark, but place the “Why” section content on a slightly lighter/different-tinted background block.

Option B:

Switch to a very light tinted background just for the “Why” fold:

.why-section {
  background: #050818;  /* slightly lighter/different tone than hero */
  padding-top: 48px;
  padding-bottom: 48px;
}


The key: soft transition, not dark → blinding white.

4️⃣ Redesign the Cards (Modern, Soft, Not Bulky)

Current cards issues:

Plain white blocks with heavy shadows

Very rounded corners

Text-heavy bullets with weak hierarchy

Feel “template-ish” and visually older than the hero

New card style (for BOTH cards):

Background: light tinted, not pure white. Use something like:
background: #f8f7ff;

Border-radius: 16px (match hero buttons if possible).

Shadow: either very subtle or none. If used:
box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.06);

Border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.04) (optional).

Padding: 20–24px on mobile, 24–32px desktop.

Full-width on mobile with consistent horizontal margin to match hero text.

Vertical spacing between cards: 16–20px.

5️⃣ Card Content Layout & Typography
Card 1: “Learn From a Product Leader”

Structure inside the card:

Small icon at the top (e.g. 👨‍🏫 or a simple vector icon)

Title

Short bullet list (max 3 bullets)

Title:

Text: “Learn From a Product Leader”

Font-size: 18–20px

Font-weight: 600

Margin-bottom: 8–12px

Bullets: (rewrite to be concise, 1 line each)

Example:

Built large-scale products across Zepto, Apollo247, Toppr & Housing.com

Grew income from ₹3 LPA to ₹2 Cr+ in 10 years

Currently Senior Director of Product at Zepto, a YC-backed $7B company

Rules:

Use simple • bullets or icons

Line-height: 1.4–1.6

Font-size: 14–15px

No long paragraphs. Keep it skim-friendly.

Card 2: “10x Your Shortlist Chances”

Title:

Text: “10x Your Shortlist Chances”

Same font size & weight as Card 1 title.

Bullets example:

Insider hiring signals most candidates never learn

A Portfolio That Proves You Can Solve Real Product Problems

A Resume Engineered to Outperform 90% of Applicants

Same typography rules as Card 1.

6️⃣ Maintain Consistent Alignment and Container Width

The left and right edges of:

the hero headline

the CTAs

the section heading

the cards

should all align within the same container width.

Implementation detail:

.container {
  max-width: 1080px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 16px; /* or 24px on desktop */
}


Use .container around both the hero content and the “Why” section content.

7️⃣ Vertical Rhythm (Spacing Guide)

Use a subtle, consistent rhythm so the page feels calm and intentional:

Space between hero buttons and “Why” heading: 48–64px

Space between “Why” heading and subtitle: 8–12px

Space between subtitle and first card: 24px

Space between cards: 16–20px

Space below second card and next section: 48–64px

8️⃣ Responsiveness

On mobile (like the screenshot):

Cards should stack vertically full-width.

Text sizes:

Section heading: 22–24px

Card titles: 18px

Body: 14–15px

Preserve generous padding so nothing feels cramped.

On desktop:

You may place the two cards side-by-side in a 2-column grid with gap: 24px, but keep the same styling and typography.

9️⃣ High-Level Feel Check

The section should feel like:

A natural continuation of the hero (same brand, same vibe).

Calm, premium, modern.

Easy to skim in 3 seconds:

“Okay, who is teaching me?”

“Okay, why is this program effective?”

No heavy shadows, no random big gaps, no weak headings.
